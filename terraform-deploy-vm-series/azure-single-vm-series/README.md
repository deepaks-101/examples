# Deploy single VM-Series to Azure with Terraform
Just a VM-Series. No other compute or services. No bootstrapping or Panorama attachment. Mostly aimed at Palo Alto Networks staff and partners such as Systems Engineers, who just want a quick way to spin up a VM-Series to test, validate or demonstrate something with an easily disposable PAN-OS device.

Instructions:
- Rename `example.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars` and change all variable values for your deployment
- Terraform init, plan, and apply
